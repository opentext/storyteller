    This is a *StoryTeller service API*. You can find out more about StoryTeller, its Document Model
    and associated services at [StoryTeller Develoment Documentation](https://opentext.github.io/storyteller/)."
    # Introduction
    As part of the *Document Platform* we provide lots of general and valuable components and 
    services which could be re-used in many other contexts outside the *Document Platform*.
    Those services are currently available inside the product and inside the document embedded 
    javascript, but we would like to be used in many other contexts as well.
    So now we are wrap the available services to a REST interface and also provide 
    a thin Javascript HTTP/REST Client Proxy for completeness. This approach opens lots of new 
    possibilities how to combine the available elements without introducing unnecessary platform 
    or language dependencies.
    It is just a matter of configuration whether we call the service locally (in-process) 
    or remotely (in a separate process), or whether we use the client code in curl, python script, 
    or in a web browser and communicate with a server via network connection.
    ## Storage
    The first facility we expose via the API is the *Storage* service. It simply serves as 
    a [Content Addressable Storage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage), 
    it enables storing any blob of data (represented as a stream),
    retrieving a content based hash key for any data uploaded and then using the key for obtaining 
    the same data back or using it for other service calls.
    The [SHA-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) cryptographic (20-bytes) hash function is used 
    for key computation and so there is a very high collision resistance. This cryptographic function 
    is very robust and future proof (other tools like [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29)
    [Distributed Revision Control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control) use the same 
    function successfully), but of course it can be easily replaced by a more robust alternative 
    ([SHA-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2), [SHA-3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3), â€¦) 
    if there is such a need.
    ## Processor
    *Processor* represents a collection of computationally intensive services provided by *Document Platform*
    to clients. Right now we expose two such *Services*:
    - TDT transformation
    - Document Formatter
    but will expose more services in near future.
    # Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
    This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with 
    [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). That allows cross-domain communication from the browser.
    All responses can have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, 
    including any code on any site if we decide to do so.
    # Authentication
    Currently there is no authentication necessary for using the service but server maintains a notion 
    of user sessions. That means that any files uploaded or created during a session are accessible
    from that particular session only. Clients are responsible for re-sending a server generated cookie
    representing particular session. Uploaded files are guaranteed to be preserved on the server only 
    for a lifetime of particular session.
